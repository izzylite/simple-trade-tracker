# Trade Gallery Mode Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a gallery mode feature that allows users to navigate through trade details using a full-screen view with keyboard navigation and next/previous buttons.

## Features

### üñºÔ∏è Gallery View
- Full-screen trade detail view using the existing `TradeDetailExpanded` component
- Clean, focused interface for viewing individual trades
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Navigation
- **Left Arrow (‚Üê)**: Navigate to previous trade
- **Right Arrow (‚Üí)**: Navigate to next trade
- **Up Arrow (‚Üë)**: Scroll up within trade details
- **Down Arrow (‚Üì)**: Scroll down within trade details
- **Escape**: Close gallery mode
- Keyboard shortcuts work globally when gallery is open

### üîÑ Navigation Controls
- Previous/Next buttons with tooltips
- Trade counter showing current position (e.g., "3 of 15")
- Date display for current trade
- Disabled state when only one trade is available

### üéØ Access Points
Gallery mode can be accessed from multiple locations:

1. **Search Results**: Click any trade from the search drawer
2. **Pinned Trades**: Click any pinned trade from the pinned trades drawer
3. **Daily Trades**: "Gallery View" button in the day dialog
4. **Monthly Trades**: "Gallery View" button in the main calendar view (shows all trades for the current month)
5. **Yearly Trades**: "Gallery View" button in the month selector dialog (shows all trades for the current year)

## Implementation Details

### New Components

#### `TradeGalleryDialog.tsx`
- Main gallery component
- Handles keyboard navigation
- Manages current trade index
- Responsive header with navigation controls

### Updated Components

#### `TradeCalendar.tsx`
- Added gallery mode state management
- Added `openGalleryMode` and `closeGalleryMode` handlers
- Updated SearchDrawer and PinnedTradesDrawer to use gallery mode
- Added TradeGalleryDialog component

#### `DayDialog.tsx`

## Usage Examples

### Opening Gallery Mode Programmatically
```typescript
// Open gallery with all trades, starting from a specific trade
openGalleryMode(trades, initialTradeId, "Custom Title");

// Open gallery with filtered trades
const pinnedTrades = trades.filter(t => t.isPinned);
openGalleryMode(pinnedTrades, trade.id, "Pinned Trades");
```

### Adding Gallery Mode to New Components
```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {
  onOpenGalleryMode?: (trades: Trade[], initialTradeId?: string, title?: string) => void;
}

const handleTradeClick = (trade: Trade) => {
  if (onOpenGalleryMode) {
    onOpenGalleryMode(relevantTrades, trade.id, "My Custom View");
  }
};
```

## User Experience

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks on a trade from any supported location
2. Gallery mode opens showing the selected trade
3. User can navigate between trades using keyboard or buttons
4. All existing trade functionality (pin/unpin, toggle type, image zoom) works
5. User can close gallery with Escape key or close button

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing app theme
- Header shows navigation controls and trade info
- Content area uses existing TradeDetailExpanded component
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Technical Notes

### State Management
- Gallery mode state is managed in TradeCalendar component
- Current trade index is managed locally in TradeGalleryDialog
- Keyboard event listeners are properly cleaned up

### Performance
- Only renders current trade (not all trades at once)
- Efficient index-based navigation
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Tooltips for navigation buttons
- Proper focus management
- Screen reader friendly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Chart Integration**: Open gallery from chart clicks
2. **Filtering**: Filter trades within gallery mode
3. **Sorting**: Sort trades by different criteria
4. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple trades in gallery
5. **Slideshow Mode**: Auto-advance through trades
6. **Bookmarks**: Save favorite trades for quick access

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large trade lists
2. **Preloading**: Preload adjacent trades
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load trade details on demand
