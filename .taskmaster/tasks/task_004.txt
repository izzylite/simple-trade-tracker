# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set Up Advanced Indexing and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create indexes to support complex queries and optimize for read-heavy workloads.
# Details:
Analyze query patterns from existing app. Add compound indexes, partial indexes, and full-text search indexes as needed. Use PostgreSQL EXPLAIN to validate performance. Recommended: Use pgvector for vector search and pg_trgm for text search.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark query performance before and after indexing. Ensure all queries meet <500ms response time.
