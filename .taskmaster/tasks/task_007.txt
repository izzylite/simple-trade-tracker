# Status: pending

# Description: Refactor frontend authentication logic to use Supabase Auth APIs.
# Details:
Replace Firebase Auth SDK calls with Supabase JS client methods for sign-in, sign-out, session management, and token refresh. Update error handling and edge cases. Recommended: Use React context or similar for auth state.

# Test Strategy:
Test all auth flows (login, logout, session expiry) across browsers and devices.
