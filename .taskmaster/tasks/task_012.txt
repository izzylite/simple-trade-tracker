# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Dual-Write System for Safe Migration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 7, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable application to write to both Firebase and Supabase during migration.
# Details:
Abstract data access layer to support dual writes. On every data mutation, write to both Firestore and Supabase. Use feature flags to toggle dual-write mode. Recommended: Use TypeScript interfaces for data models.

# Test Strategy:
Verify data consistency between Firebase and Supabase after mutations.
