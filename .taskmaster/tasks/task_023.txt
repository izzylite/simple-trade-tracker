# Task ID: 23
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform functional, performance, security, and load testing.
# Details:
Write automated tests using Jest, Cypress, or Playwright. Conduct performance testing with k6 or Artillery. Perform security audit and penetration testing. Run load tests for 1000+ concurrent users.

# Test Strategy:
All tests must pass. Performance and security benchmarks must be met.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Test Coverage and Acceptance Criteria [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the scope of functional, performance, security, and load testing. Specify acceptance criteria and benchmarks for each testing type.
### Details:
Document all features, endpoints, and user flows to be tested. Set clear pass/fail criteria for functional correctness, performance thresholds, and security standards.

## 2. Set Up Automated Functional Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Configure and initialize automated testing frameworks such as Jest, Cypress, or Playwright for the project.
### Details:
Install and configure the chosen test framework(s) based on project needs. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated execution.

## 3. Develop and Maintain Automated Functional Test Suites [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Write comprehensive automated tests covering all critical user flows, edge cases, and regression scenarios.
### Details:
Implement tests for UI, API, and business logic. Ensure tests are modular, maintainable, and provide clear reporting.

## 4. Configure and Execute Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Set up performance testing tools such as k6 or Artillery and design scenarios to measure system throughput and latency.
### Details:
Define realistic user scenarios and load profiles. Configure scripts to simulate expected and peak loads.

## 5. Conduct Load Testing for High Concurrency [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Design and execute load tests simulating 1000+ concurrent users to validate system scalability and stability.
### Details:
Use k6 or Artillery to simulate concurrent users. Monitor system behavior under sustained and peak loads.

## 6. Perform Security Audit and Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive security review and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Use automated scanners and manual techniques to test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, authentication, authorization, etc.).

## 7. Integrate Test Automation with CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.5, 23.6
### Description: Ensure all automated tests (functional, performance, security) are executed as part of the CI/CD process.
### Details:
Configure CI/CD workflows to trigger tests on code changes and deployments. Set up notifications for failures.

## 8. Analyze Test Results and Report Quality Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.7
### Description: Aggregate and analyze test results to provide actionable quality metrics and insights to stakeholders.
### Details:
Generate reports on test coverage, pass/fail rates, performance benchmarks, and security findings. Present results to the team.
