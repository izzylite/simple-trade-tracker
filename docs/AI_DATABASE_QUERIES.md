# AI Database Query Function Setup

This guide explains how to set up the AI database query function that allows your AI assistant to execute SQL queries directly against your Supabase database.

## üéØ What This Adds

- **Direct Database Access**: AI can query your Supabase database directly
- **Flexible Analysis**: AI can create custom queries for complex analysis
- **Real-time Data**: Access to the most current data in your database
- **Advanced Insights**: Complex aggregations and joins that aren't possible with pre-built functions

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the SQL Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `src/database/supabase-sql-functions.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This creates:
- `execute_sql()` function for secure query execution
- Helper views for common queries
- Proper security restrictions

### 2. Security Features

The implementation includes several security measures:

- **SELECT Only**: Only SELECT queries are allowed
- **Keyword Filtering**: Blocks dangerous operations (DROP, DELETE, etc.)
- **User Isolation**: Automatically adds user_id filters where needed
- **Error Handling**: Safe error reporting without exposing sensitive data

## üöÄ How It Works

### Available Database Tables

1. **trade_embeddings** - Raw trade data with vector embeddings
   - `trade_id`, `user_id`, `calendar_id`
   - `trade_type`, `trade_amount`, `trade_date`
   - `trade_session`, `tags[]`
   - `embedding` (vector), `embedded_content`

2. **embedding_metadata** - Embedding sync tracking
   - `user_id`, `calendar_id`
   - `model_name`, `total_trades`, `last_sync_at`

### Pre-built Views

1. **user_trade_embeddings_summary**
   - Aggregated statistics per user/calendar
   - Win rates, trade counts, date ranges

2. **trade_embeddings_by_session**
   - Performance breakdown by trading session
   - London, New York, Tokyo, Sydney

3. **trade_embeddings_by_day**
   - Performance by day of week
   - Monday through Sunday analysis

4. **trade_embeddings_by_month**
   - Monthly performance trends
   - Total amounts, averages, win/loss counts

5. **trade_embeddings_tag_analysis**
   - Tag usage and performance
   - Most common tags, success rates per tag

## üí° Example AI Queries

The AI can now handle queries like:

### Basic Queries
- "How many trades do I have in the database?"
- "What's my win rate by trading session?"
- "Show me my monthly performance trends"

### Advanced Analysis
- "Which tags have the highest win rates?"
- "What's my average trade size by day of week?"
- "Show me trades from the last 30 days with specific tags"

### Custom SQL
- "Run a query to find my best performing months"
- "Analyze correlation between trade session and profitability"
- "Get detailed statistics for trades with multiple tags"

## üîç Sample Queries the AI Might Generate

```sql
-- Monthly performance summary
SELECT 
    month_label,
    trade_count,
    total_amount,
    wins,
    losses,
    ROUND((wins::DECIMAL / trade_count) * 100, 2) as win_rate
FROM trade_embeddings_by_month 
WHERE user_id = 'user123'
ORDER BY month;

-- Best performing tags
SELECT 
    tag,
    tag_count,
    wins_with_tag,
    losses_with_tag,
    ROUND((wins_with_tag::DECIMAL / tag_count) * 100, 2) as tag_win_rate
FROM trade_embeddings_tag_analysis 
WHERE user_id = 'user123'
ORDER BY tag_win_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Session performance comparison
SELECT 
    trade_session,
    trade_count,
    avg_amount,
    win_rate
FROM trade_embeddings_by_session 
WHERE user_id = 'user123'
ORDER BY win_rate DESC;
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### What's Protected
- Only SELECT queries allowed
- Automatic user_id AND calendar_id filtering
- No access to other users' or calendars' data
- Blocked dangerous SQL operations

### What's Allowed
- Complex SELECT statements
- JOINs between tables
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Date/time functions
- String functions

### What's Blocked
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- DROP, CREATE, ALTER statements
- GRANT, REVOKE permissions
- Any query without proper user filtering

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Unlimited Analysis**: AI can create any SELECT query needed
2. **Real-time Data**: Direct access to current database state
3. **Complex Insights**: Multi-table joins and advanced aggregations
4. **Flexible Reporting**: Custom reports based on user questions
5. **Performance**: Direct database access is faster than multiple API calls

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Function execute_sql does not exist"**
   - Run the SQL setup script in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Ensure you have proper permissions

2. **"Only SELECT queries are allowed"**
   - This is expected behavior for security
   - AI should only generate SELECT statements

3. **"No data returned"**
   - Check if trade embeddings exist for the user
   - Verify user_id filtering is working correctly

4. **"Permission denied"**
   - Ensure RLS policies are properly configured
   - Check that the user is authenticated

The AI database query function provides powerful, flexible analysis capabilities while maintaining security and data isolation! üöÄ
